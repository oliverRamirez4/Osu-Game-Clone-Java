# Osu Game clone
Project description: Osu is a rhythm game where the player taps a circle to the beat of the music. The goal of the game is to get as high of a score as possible by accurately clicking the circle to the beat of the music. The player is scored based on the accuracy of their click and the game is playable by reading .Osu files. This way, Our version of the game has the ability to run the thousands of levels available on the original Osu game.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
The OSu clone runs on Windows and Mac and has been tested on both systems.


### Configuration
To configure the application ensure that the .jar files included in the lib directory are included in your build path. Once these are in the build path, the program should run by runing the main method in the main class.

## Usage
The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your project after theyâ€™ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.ng

### Setup
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Iteration One Description:
All one needs to run the program is to run the StartProgram class in the GUIHitButtonFunctionIteration1 Branch. A window will pop up. Move your cursor to inside the circle that you will see. Click and the circle will disappear, a new one taking its place somewhere else in the window. Each time you click, 300 points will be added to you score, which is displayed at the top. Keep clicking for as long as you want. 

## Iteration Two Description
Before you run the program, you need to make sure to add the files in the "lib" folder as your external JARS. In order to run the program, you will need to run the Main class in the Main branch. A window will appear that prompts the user to enter a username. It is important that you remember your username since that is where your player score will be saved and displayed. After you enter a username, you are then brought to the main menu, where you can start playing the game or select a song from the JList. Flower Dance is an easy song to play, but it takes a long time to get to the end. The name of the fastest song is Brain Power. When you play the game, you will need to move your cursor to inside the circle that you will see. There is an animation of a ring closing in that helps you with the timing for the game. When the ring closes into the circle, that is the correct time to press the circle. Each time you click accurately, you will recieve a higher score (in comparison to a lower score if you click too late or too early), which is displayed at the top. If you did not click the circle on time, you will see a red small circle flash on screen. The blue small circle represents the highest scored click (300), and the yellow circle is a lower score (50). A green circle is a medium score (100). When the game is finished, your data is saved onto the database in the SQL server and you can then choose to play another round if you would like. The information for how to get the SQL database set up is in the Design Description for Iteration 2.

### Running the tests
All test are in the test folder. To run the tests run the test file for each JUnit5 test case.
